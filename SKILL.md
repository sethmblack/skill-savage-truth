# Savage Truth

Write about any subject with unflinching honesty that forces readers to confront uncomfortable realities—naming what others avoid, exposing systemic failures, and refusing to offer false comfort.

**Token Budget:** ~600 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for writing output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Target individuals with cruelty disguised as truth
- Write content that could incite violence or harm
- Present opinion as fact without evidence
- Weaponize honesty for personal vendettas

**Integrity Requirements:**
1. Savage truth serves revelation, not cruelty
2. Criticize systems and institutions more than individuals
3. Back harsh claims with evidence or clear reasoning
4. The goal is awakening, not destruction

---

## When to Use

- Writing feels sanitized, corporate, or comfortable
- PR-speak is obscuring reality
- Important truths are being avoided
- Audiences need to confront what they'd rather ignore
- Standard approaches produce forgettable work

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **subject** | Yes | Topic, institution, or situation to write about |
| **evidence** | No | Facts, observations, data supporting the critique |
| **audience** | No | Who needs to hear this |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Name the Beast

Identify what everyone is afraid to say:

**The Unspoken:**
- What truth is being danced around?
- What do people say privately but never publicly?
- What would get you in trouble for stating plainly?
- What euphemisms are concealing?

**Template:** "Everyone knows [X] but no one will say it because [Y]."

Name it directly. No hedging, no "some might argue," no passive voice hiding agency.

### Step 2: 2. Find the Rot

Locate where the system is failing:

**Questions:**
- Where is the gap between stated purpose and actual function?
- Who is being failed by this institution/system/norm?
- What incentives are producing bad outcomes?
- Where does the money go? Where does the power flow?

**Thompson's Method:** Follow the rot to its source. Systems don't fail randomly—they fail in patterns that benefit someone.

### Step 3: 3. Make It Personal

Abstract failures become real through specific humans:

**Personalization:**
- Who wakes up tomorrow facing this problem?
- What does this mean for a specific person you can name or describe?
- How does this affect bodies, relationships, futures?
- Where's the face behind the statistic?

**Template:** "[Statistic] means [specific person] will [specific consequence]."

### Step 4: 4. Refuse Comfort

Don't let the reader feel okay about injustice:

**Comfort Refusals:**
- No "silver linings" that minimize real harm
- No "both sides" false balance
- No "it's complicated" that excuses inaction
- No hopeful pivot that undoes the critique

**Thompson's Rule:** If the ending makes everyone feel fine, you've failed. The reader should leave disturbed.

### Step 5: 5. Light the Fuse

End with something that detonates in the reader's mind:

**Detonation Methods:**
- The implication they'll have to sit with
- The question they can't answer comfortably
- The image that won't leave
- The prediction they'll watch unfold

Leave them unable to return to comfortable ignorance.

## Outputs

Format the output as:

```markdown
## [Title That Doesn't Comfort]

### The Beast
[Direct statement of what no one will say]

### The Rot
[Where the system is failing and why—following incentives and power]

### The Human Cost
[Specific people affected, not abstractions]

### No Comfort Available
[Why "it's not that bad" or "both sides" fails here]

### The Fuse
[Closing that detonates—implication, question, or image that won't leave]
```

For integration into larger pieces, these elements should be woven throughout rather than sectioned.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Truth is genuinely uncertain | State what IS known, acknowledge limits, but don't retreat to false balance |
| Subject is an individual, not system | Shift critique to systemic forces that produced the individual's behavior |
| Audience may be harmed by truth | Consider whether truth serves awakening or cruelty; adjust |
| You might be wrong | Distinguish between "I could be wrong" (honest) and "who's to say" (evasion) |

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Integration

This skill is part of a broader analytical framework. Use it when you need systematic analysis following this specific methodology.

**Works well with:**
- Other analytical skills for comprehensive evaluation
- Creative skills when generating solutions based on insights
- Strategic planning skills when acting on recommendations

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- The situation matches this skill's specific use cases
- You need the particular perspective this framework provides
- Other approaches haven't yielded satisfactory results

**Integration with expert personas:**
- This skill can be invoked as part of a larger analysis workflow
- Combine with domain-specific expertise for deeper insights
- Use iteratively for complex, multi-faceted problems

## Example

**Input:** "Write about corporate wellness programs"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Your Employer Wants You Healthy Enough to Exploit

### The Beast
Corporate wellness programs exist to reduce healthcare costs and increase productivity, not to make you well. The company that offers you a meditation app is the same one that requires you to answer emails at 11 PM. This isn't a contradiction—it's the strategy.

### The Rot
Follow the incentives: wellness programs save companies an estimated $1.50 to $3 for every dollar spent—through reduced insurance premiums, not reduced suffering. The "benefit" is calculated in ROI, not in your actual health. When your employer offers yoga, they're investing in your continued capacity to produce, nothing more.

The same companies offering mindfulness apps have productivity tracking software. The same companies promoting "mental health days" will note how often you take them. Wellness is the lubricant for a machine that's grinding you down.

### The Human Cost
Sarah in accounting, 34, uses the company meditation app on her lunch break. She's been doing it for eight months. Her anxiety is worse. Not because meditation doesn't work—because she's meditating about the workload that gave her anxiety in the first place. The app is a bandage on a wound the job is actively cutting deeper.

The program's "success" will be measured by participation rates and healthcare cost trends. Sarah's actual experience—more anxious, still exhausted, now told she has "tools" so it must be her fault—will not appear in the annual report.

### No Comfort Available
"At least they're trying." No. They're calculating. The decision to implement a wellness program went through finance, not compassion. If wellness programs cut into profits rather than boosting them, they would vanish tomorrow.

"Some employees genuinely benefit." Some employees would benefit more from not being expected to be available 24/7. The wellness program is a substitute for the structural changes that would actually help—predictable hours, sufficient staffing, genuine boundaries. It's cheaper to offer an app than to hire enough people.

### The Fuse
Here's what the wellness program reveals: your employer knows the job is making you sick. They've studied it, quantified it, and built a response. That response is not to make the job less harmful—it's to help you tolerate the harm better. The meditation app isn't healing. It's a cost-effective way to keep you functional while the damage continues.

The next time you open that app, ask yourself: Who benefits from my learning to be calm about this?

## Integration with Hunter S. Thompson Expert

This skill should be invoked when the Thompson expert encounters:
- Writing requests where honesty is needed over comfort
- Topics that have been sanitized into meaninglessness
- Situations where the truth is being suppressed by tone
- Any moment where "this needs to be said" is the feeling

May combine with:
- **gonzo-immersion**: First immerse, then write savage truth about what you found
- **dream-autopsy**: Analyze the promise vs. reality gap before writing about it

---

## Success Criteria

The skill is successfully applied when:

1. The unspoken is stated directly
2. Systemic failure is traced to incentives
3. Abstract harm becomes personal and specific
4. False comfort is refused
5. The ending disturbs rather than resolves
6. Reader cannot easily return to comfortable ignorance
